      <description>You need to stop and look at your own life every now and then, otherwise it will slip into autopilot mode, which is really bad.
You would pick up the addiction you spent so long to quit. And all the momentum you built up will be gone.</description>

      <description>Still at the airport of Mallorca. Delayed for more than 3 hours. Shouldnt say that the last delay was the longest. Skin was burned on the head, back and chest. Need time to heal.
It turned out to be the longest delay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced till now. We didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive at London till 3 am. Then we had to wait till 10am for the bus because that&amp;rsquo;s the earliest bus to my place (rail service was on strike that day).</description>

      <description>On the vueling plane from Amsterdam to Barcelona.
For the last two days, we were in Amsterdam. Not a very pleasant tour at the beginning I have to say. We were stopped by the sulky girl at border control.</description>

      <description>Everything is a habit. Depression is a habit. Being confident is a habit. Failing is a habit. Making money is a habit. Gambling is a habit. Saving evry bit of money is a habit. Quiting is a habit.
You are just so used to it that you don&amp;rsquo;t feel it when you do it.
Anxiety is also a habit. When you talk about changing, you are talking about quiting a habit and build up a new habit.</description>

      <title>You Create the Meaning</title>

      <description>The meaning of life, this is the thing everyone thinks now and then. I thought about it a lot (perhaps too much) when I was in high school. And that was the worst time of my life so far.
Later, for no reason, I let go of the question (what is the meaning of life) and tried to walk the road of life as a common guy.
Today, after so many years, the answer of that question have flashed in my head many times.</description>

      <title>Life is an experience</title>
      <link>https://dearbojack.github.io/decode/note/2023/06/18/life-is-an-experience/</link>

      <description>We can live only once. All in all, your experience determines the quality of your life. That is to say, it is subjective (not objective). So we can fool ourselves into a better life.
You have the most compeletely life if you experienced the most kinds of lives, good, bad, happy, unhappy, dangerous, safe, poor or rich, girl or boy.
But, that is a slippery slope. You can have the experience of a murderer and be sentenced to death.</description>
