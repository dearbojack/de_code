      <description>Still at the airport of Mallorca. Delayed for more than 3 hours. Shouldnt say that the last delay was the longest. Skin was burned on the head, back and chest. Need time to heal.
It turned out to be the longest delay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced till now. We didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive at London till 3 am. Then we had to wait till 10am for the bus because that&amp;rsquo;s the earliest bus to my place (rail service was on strike that day).</description>

      <description>On the vueling plane from Amsterdam to Barcelona.
For the last two days, we were in Amsterdam. Not a very pleasant tour at the beginning I have to say. We were stopped by the sulky girl at border control.</description>
