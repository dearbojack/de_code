      <description>Writing is relaxing.
 When you feel drown by anxiety, just sit down and start writing something. About what? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. There is paid classes on social media called &amp;ldquo;mindful writing&amp;rdquo;. Though I would never pay for that, but I agree with the idea behind the classes. Writing is the easiest way to get into the &amp;ldquo;flowing&amp;rdquo; state, which is sought after by most people who practice mindful related things.</description>

      <title>No Autopilot Life</title>

      <description>You need to stop and look at your own life every now and then, otherwise it will slip into autopilot mode, which is really bad.
You would pick up the addiction you spent so long to quit. And all the momentum you built up will be gone.</description>

      <title>My Will</title>

      <description>如果我突然离世，我会有什么最后的话想跟这个世界说的呢？
 最近在推特上关注的一个技术圈的大佬忽然离世，让我颇为震动。虽然并不认识，但就好像是前几天的晚上还看到他在发布一些日常的状态，然后突然人没了，这个账号永远再也不会更新了。他是不是还有些话想说呢？
其实我自己并不害怕“死亡”，我更怕的其实是周围人的“死亡”，那些自己熟悉的人突然消失不见了。这个让人不知道该如何面对，如何接受。
想想如果自己突然心梗，会有什么话还要说吗？有什么没做的想做的事已经不重要了，所以到了现在这个年纪忽然就要想想该写遗书了？把自己特别想说的话先写下来，这样自己突然噶了也就没什么需要死不瞑目了。</description>

      <title>All is Habit</title>

      <description>Everything is a habit. Depression is a habit. Being confident is a habit. Failing is a habit. Making money is a habit. Gambling is a habit. Saving evry bit of money is a habit. Quiting is a habit.
You are just so used to it that you don&amp;rsquo;t feel it when you do it.
Anxiety is also a habit. When you talk about changing, you are talking about quiting a habit and build up a new habit.</description>

      <title>You Create the Meaning</title>

      <description>The meaning of life, this is the thing everyone thinks now and then. I thought about it a lot (perhaps too much) when I was in high school. And that was the worst time of my life so far.
Later, for no reason, I let go of the question (what is the meaning of life) and tried to walk the road of life as a common guy.
Today, after so many years, the answer of that question have flashed in my head many times.</description>

      <title>Life is an experience</title>

      <description>We can live only once. All in all, your experience determines the quality of your life. That is to say, it is subjective (not objective). So we can fool ourselves into a better life.
You have the most compeletely life if you experienced the most kinds of lives, good, bad, happy, unhappy, dangerous, safe, poor or rich, girl or boy.
But, that is a slippery slope. You can have the experience of a murderer and be sentenced to death.</description>
