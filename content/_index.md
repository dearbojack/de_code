Here is the life of a rather common people.

I like playing games. Life is about experiences and by playing good games you can experience the life of the hero immersively. Great games in my view: Dark Souls III, Sekiro, Hollow Knight, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring, Red Dead Redemption 2, Dead Cells, The Witcher: Wild Hunt. Lately, I'm playing **Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (totk)** and it is great.

I like playing with codes. I just graduated from a frontend bootcamp but long before that I have been playing with linux distros and all kinds of command line tools back in the university. Though I haven't created any thing yet, I am still trying.

I think a lot and I'd like to write those fleeting thoughts down so they can last a little longer, though I know they are just some foolish doodles on the beach.

Here pieces of thoughts are in [note](/decode/note) and longer or more wholesome pieces are in [post](/decode/post). Nothing eles.
