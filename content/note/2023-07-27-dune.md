Today, I had the chance to watch the movie *Dune*. While the plot may be straightforward, the film's captivating tempo and storytelling truly grabbed my attention. So I took note of several thought-provoking lines.

*On Life*: “The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”

*On Fear*:

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

*On Living*: “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.”

*On Survival*: **“Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.”**
