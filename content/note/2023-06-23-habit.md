Everything is a habit. Depression is a habit. Being confident is a habit. Failing is a habit. Making money is a habit. Gambling is a habit. Saving evry bit of money is a habit. Quiting is a habit.

You are just so used to it that you don't feel it when you do it. 

Anxiety is also a habit. When you talk about changing, you are talking about quiting a habit and build up a new habit. 

This is the essence of those books.
