> Still at the airport of Mallorca. Delayed for more than 3 hours. Shouldnt say that the last delay was the longest. Skin was burned on the head, back and chest. Need time to heal. 

It turned out to be the longest delay I've ever experienced till now. We didn't arrive at London till 3 am. Then we had to wait till 10am for the bus because that's the earliest bus to my place (rail service was on strike that day).

To sum it up, we wait for more than 6 hours in the airport for the flight and another 7 hours after it arrived. We missed the bus we booked earlier, had to buy new tickets. We arrived home around 12, more than 10 hours late than we expected.

相比下来，马略卡可能是此行最让人不那么不喜欢的地方了。吃的东西比巴塞罗那和阿姆斯特特丹都便宜一些，海也很干净，酒店也还可以。下次可以直接飞马略卡玩了。
