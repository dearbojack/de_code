We can live only once. All in all, your experience determines the quality of your life. That is to say, it is subjective (not objective). So we can fool ourselves into a better life. 

You have the most compeletely life if you experienced the most kinds of lives, good, bad, happy, unhappy, dangerous, safe, poor or rich, girl or boy.

But, that is a slippery slope. You can have the experience of a murderer and be sentenced to death. That is special. You can also try your best to be the richest man in the world.

It can be a positive force, and a negative one.

That is how I think about life.
