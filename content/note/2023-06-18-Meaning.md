The meaning of life, this is the thing everyone thinks now and then. I thought about it a lot (perhaps too much) when I was in high school. And that was the worst time of my life so far.

Later, for no reason, I let go of the question (what is the meaning of life) and tried to walk the road of life as a common guy.

Today, after so many years, the answer of that question have flashed in my head many times. That is, **Originally, there is no meaning. You need to create the meaning of your life when you live it.**

Yes, that is it.
