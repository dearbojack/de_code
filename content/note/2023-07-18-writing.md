> Writing is relaxing.

When you feel drown by anxiety, just sit down and start writing something. About what? It doesn't matter. There is paid classes on social media called "mindful writing". Though I would never pay for that, but I agree with the idea behind the classes. Writing is the easiest way to get into the "flowing" state, which is sought after by most people who practice mindful related things.

Just start writing down what you are thinking and you will feel less stressed and a little bit of your anxiety goes away.
