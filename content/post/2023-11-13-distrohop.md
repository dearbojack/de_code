最近闲来无事，又开始了大学时候就一直玩得停不下来的Linux系统安装实验，感觉自己有病。

Tried *Manjaro*, *Pop!OS*, *Fedora*, *OpenSuse*, *Ubuntu*, etc. One thing I have to say is they have advanced alot since the last time I played (that was Ubuntu 6/8.04, around 2009 or so). Media codecs and Chinese IME are all working properly. Though some apps require some tweaking a bit, most of the functions people expect from a working laptop are okay.

Based on the *distrohop*, I have below conclusions:

1. *Pop!OS* is the best distro out there.
2. `ibus-rime` is the best Chinsese IME out there.
3. `PaperWM` is the future of window management across all platforms.
4. **Gnome** > Xfce >> KDE

Based on stability and out-of-box usability, *Pop!OS* is unquestionably the best. And also due to the popularity of `Ubuntu`, it also has more `.deb` packages. Most of the popular apps offer `.deb` packages, like VSCode & Obsidian.

Manjaro is also good, but the rolling release is kind of painful for someone who just wants a stable daily drive OS. Other distros either have ugly custimization or not-so-easy installation process, on which Pop is clearly the best and fastest.

I have to say, with its promising commercialization strategy, `Pop!OS` surely will become better in the future. (Ubuntu is just too bloated.)
