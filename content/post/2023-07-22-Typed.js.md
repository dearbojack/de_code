Today, I learned how to use `react-typed`. It is really simple, but the result is quite fancy.

You can get a typewriter effect and deletion effect with simple code like below (in a react project): 

```js
import React from 'react';
import Typed from 'react-typed';

const Hero = () => {
  return (
    <div className='text-white'>
        <div>
          <p>You can easily earn money for</p>
          <Typed 
            strings={['me', 'you', 'all']} 
            typeSpeed={120} 
            backSpeed={160} 
            loop
          />
        </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Hero
```

So I did a search and found that [`react-typed`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typed) is a wrapper around the original [`Typed.js`](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js).
