Has been learning Swift for the last couple of days. Day 9 of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Today, when trying to solve the quiz of finding the square root of a given number (without using the built-in `sqrt()`), I learned the binary search algorithm in Swift.

The core codes: 
```swift
var low = 1
var high = number
var result = 0

while low <= high {
    let mid = (low + high) / 2
    if mid * mid == number {
        return mid
    } else if mid * mid < number {
        low = mid + 1
        result = mid
    } else {
        high = mid - 1
    }
}
```

It's kind of interesting, so I tried to write the binary search in Swift (finding the index of a given target in a given array). Pretty much the same.

```swift
var low = 0
var high = array.count - 1

while low <= high {
    let mid = low + (high - low) / 2
    
    if array[mid] == target {
        return mid
    } else if array[mid] < target {
        low = mid + 1
    } else {
        high = mid - 1
    }
}
```

I'm starting to get the beauty of algorithm. I think that's mainly because I checked the problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) lately. And I read the book [Hello Algorithm](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_searching/binary_search/), which was quite well-written and well-designed.
