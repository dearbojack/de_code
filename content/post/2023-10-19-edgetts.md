I like the read out loud in Edge browser on MacOS, but it's not available in Linux. Luckily, there is a [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) created by rany2 on Github. 

So, I asked ChatGPT create several scripts to read out the clipboard and convert a txt file to audio. 

Dependencies: python, pip, pipx, edge-tts, xclip. Took me sometime to install all the deps. Then to use the scripts, just copy some text and run the bash script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if xclip is installed
if ! command -v xclip &> /dev/null
then
    echo "xclip is not installed. Please install it before running this script."
    exit
fi

# Check if edge-tts is installed
if ! command -v edge-tts &> /dev/null
then
    echo "edge-tts is not installed. Please install it before running this script."
    exit
fi

# Get the text from the clipboard
text=$(xclip -o)

# Check if there's any text to read
if [ -z "$text" ]
then
    echo "Clipboard is empty. Nothing to read."
    exit
fi

# Use edge-tts to read out the text

# here i use chinese voice & speed x 1.25
edge-playback --rate=+50% --voice zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural --text "$text"

# you can use default english voice directly
# edge-playback --rate=+25% --text "$text"

```
