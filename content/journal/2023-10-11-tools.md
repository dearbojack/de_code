Tweaking i3-wm on Manjaro, and Pop!OS. Lost my i3 config for logging out and shutdown. Earlier, I reinstalled Catalina on the old Macbook. I also had a Mac Mini in the suitcase, no 4k monitor here, so not turning it on recently.

Besides, I play with phones, Nothing Phone 1 and the old iPhone 11. And kindle, and kindle fire tablet which I bought on Amazon on the last Prime Day. 

I'm playing with so many tools, yet I refrain from actually using the tools to create something, which makes all the tools useless, right?

You should focus on creating something, not tweaking the tools or spending hours setting up the so-called perfect workflow. Though those "methodologies" can also be some kind of output if you can sell them, but most of the time they are just your personal way of doing things. IF you are not somebody, nobody cares how you do things. SO, create things now, stop tweaking those fucking tools.
