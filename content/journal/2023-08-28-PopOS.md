Don't know why lightdm failed to start, though I managed to switch to gdm and boot to gnome, but still I was unable to start xfce or i3, where I use to work. So, just installed Pop!OS 22.04 LTS on another partition. The rolling release of Manjaro, though interesting, is not so stable for daily use, I guess.

The switch is somewhat uneventful. Almost all apps I use were available also. So I just started hacking the algorithm problems on LeetCode with the help of Bing and ChatGPT. They are both better than me.

List out some basic setup for future reference:
- Edge + all the extensions (in sync);
- fonts, copyQ, flameshot, alacritty
- python pip pipx venv (for python pkg management)
- git ssh setup (notes & decode blog)

过两天就要搬家了，早上去了最后一次超市采购，希望一切顺利吧。
