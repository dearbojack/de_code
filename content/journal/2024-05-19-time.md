> How you spend your time is how you live your life.

What do you do in your spare time? I have nothing but spare time. I wasted all my time and attention on something that is meaningless as seen by 2 biao. I have been on autopilot for a long time - drifting with the waves, escaping from what I should do. She has been too nice to me. I am ashamed of myself. 

For now, if I fail the interview on Wednesday, I don't what I should do. I might as well kill myself to stop all this bullshit. When you die, nothing is important anymore, everything is gone. So just go die a coward. 

Spend your time on something meaningful to you, or to others. Do something meaningful.

已经快晚上十点了，天还是没有黑。远处天边是漂亮的渐变色，淡蓝，灰白，粉红，下面暗蓝色的影子好像是云，好像是远处看不到的山，再下面就是地平线了，再下面就是一片片的地面，点缀着大大小小灯光的是居民区，黑得深邃的是公园。住在这高楼的好处之一就是看得远，景色不错。坏处就是晴天的时候热得要命。不拉窗帘简直能把人烤熟，拉上窗帘就是蒸熟。但是走到楼下也没有那么热，所以你说说这是为什么。

卡顿，默认输入法打中文总有卡顿。不知道原因是什么。就是因为这个原因换到旧的系统，但还是没有改观。
