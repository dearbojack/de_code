I hate LinkedIn. (I hate work.) I hate to think about social network and personal branding. Just not my thing.

I hate dark mode, especially thought site with super dark background and tiny fonts and bragging about design. Bullshit. Your site is just shit. Pain in the eyes.

I hate Microsoft Edge. I used to like it a lot, the vertical tabs, the read out loud, then everything starts to go wrong, the ads, the BingChat shit, the copilot shit, the right side bar, the workspace, what the fuck are all those shit. Malware. And you can hardly remove it (on Windows). Just shit.

OK, enough of bad mouth. Calm down. The world is full of ugly things, just don't use them. Focus on things that you love. 

Phew.
