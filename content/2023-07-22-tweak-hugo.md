It is such a pain in the ass to tweak hugo around. Every time when you think everything is okay, then some other stuff came up and you had to spend some extra time to fix. And the syntax of go is so hard to read, nearly unreadable. And I want to say, so this is it, good or bad, this is the final look of the blog. I will write for some years and to see if there is any need to make it better.
